# Week 2 â€“ Data Encryption Tutorial

This folder contains all files related to **Week 2** of CST-407: Application Security Foundations.

## Contents

- **RSAEncryptionApp/**  
  A simple Java-based RSA encryption/decryption program created as part of the assignment. Includes source and compiled class files.

- **Activity 2 Data Encryption Tutorial.pdf**  
  Final submitted version of Activity 2 in PDF format.

- **CST-407-RS-T2-Activity-2-Data-Encryption-Tutorial.docx**  
  Original assignment guide template provided by the instructor with completed responses.

## Summary

Activity 2 focused on hands-on data encryption using both graphical and command-line tools. Key learning components included:

- Generating public and private key pairs using GPG Suite
- Performing symmetric and asymmetric encryption
- Signing and verifying messages using digital signatures
- Encrypting and decrypting messages via CLI
- Creating a custom RSA encryption and decryption Java program

The Java app demonstrates basic RSA functionality including:
- Prime number generation
- Key pair creation (public and private)
- Encryption and decryption of a user message
- Byte and ASCII conversions

## Submission Notes

- The `.pdf` file was uploaded for final grading.
- The `.docx` file shows the structured format from the instructor's template.
- The `RSAEncryptionApp` folder contains a working command-line Java application that supports RSA encryption.
